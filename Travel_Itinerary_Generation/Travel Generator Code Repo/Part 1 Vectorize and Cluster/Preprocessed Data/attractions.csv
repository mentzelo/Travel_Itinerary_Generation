It started operating for the first time back in 1909 at the ground level of an Athenian old mansion in the heart of Plaka. At those premises, his founder Mr Michael Brettos, started producing ouzo, brandy and few liqueur flavors, from the old time classics like cherry and pepermint to the most distinct ones like citrus and masticha, using old family recipes from Smyrni (Izmir, Turkey). When demand started rising more that expected he had to relocate the distillery to Kallithea and operate the small shop on Kydathineon street only as a liquor shop and at the same time as a bar where tourists as well as local could taste and buy any liqueur they wished for. After all these decades “Brettos” distillery and bar is still the best place to have a few drinks after work, after a good meal, or just before you go to sleep. Without any lifestyle codes, with soft music coming from a small radio forgotten on one of the wooden shelves, “Brettos” is the perfect place is you wish to get away form everyday life and have a chat with your friends. The only thing that could surprise you are the flashes coming from the cameras of all shorts of tourist that visit the store daily.
