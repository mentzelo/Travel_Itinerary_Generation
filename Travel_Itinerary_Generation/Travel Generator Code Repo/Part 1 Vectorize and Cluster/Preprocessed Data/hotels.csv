With 36 beautifully appointed rooms and suites and 15 different room types, the one thing you can be sure of, is that NLH Monastiraki promises a singularly different experience for each of its guests.

The calm and serenity indoors contrasts with the high-octane activity on the bustling Athinas and Pallados streets, exuding Athens’ unstoppable energy. The Standard Rooms at NLH Monastiraki offer great value-for-money stays; the Lofts offer a singularly different experience spread across two levels; while the spacious Suites are designed to accommodate the needs of our most demanding guests.

Standard fixtures in all rooms include a work desk, a 43'' Smart TV with satellite channels, a laptop safe and a mini fridge. Free WiFi access is provided throughout. As you walk into the stylish reception area, you absorb the philosophy of easy elegance. Everything in this iconic building is a reminder of its rich history, but it comes through in a very accessible, organic way. Done up in rich black and white marble, the reception area on the ground floor, transports you to a gentler, more civilized era. Walk up to the first floor for a quiet coffee at the lobby bar or grab a snack from the “neighborfood” corner, through our vending machines that operate round-the-clock.

An important characteristic and element of The Marblous is the key role of the windows, both in the rooms and in the breakfast bistrot at the ground floor; they act as small, colorful “pictures of Athens” hanging on the walls and allowing the visitor to feel the city vibes in the most living and direct way possible. Women discretely played an important role while creating the core of this concept (whether they are travelling alone, with their friends, their partner or their family) and their needs are taken into consideration on all levels of its operation. From the first glance, this philosophy manifests itself primarily in its particular aesthetic identity, which combines the timeless texture of blushing marble tiles with a pastel color palette and select elements of curvature and softness, making one immediately feels an elegant sense of calm while creating a minimalist style that elicits a sense of well-being. Moving on, it is also apparent in its comfortable and tasteful rooms and suites (some of which have a view of the city and the Acropolis), which include “marvellous” pampering details that make all the difference, like full-length mirrors, work desks / dressing tables and luxury brand beauty and personal care products for our guests.

Bob W is the smartest alternative to hotels and random rentals. Every night is climate-neutral and fully carbon offset. Get everything needed to live, work and play for as long as you want: keyless access, fast WiFi, local gym access, 24/7 support, and regular professional cleaning – you name it. It is also possible to request early check-in and late check-out.

When you stay with Bob, you’re getting an authentic taste of the local neighbourhood. This iconic Athens building near Plaka was built in 1946.
Bob is the mythical globetrotter who calls nowhere home but is at ease anywhere. After travelling around the world from Chicago to Kathmandu and everywhere in between, Bob has developed refined taste when it comes to accommodation. His holy grail are places that blend the consistent quality of a hotel with the authentic flair and affordability of a host’s home. The problem is that these types of places are almost impossible to find. That’s why he decided to create his own category of exceptionally cool short-stay accommodation that combines the best of both worlds. 

When you sleep with Bob, you always know what to expect: an awesome location in a handpicked neighbourhood, interiors created by local designers, and a commitment to sustainability.  Welcome to Bob’s world!
Staying at Bob W Eolou is an immersive experience in the heart of Athens' bustling energy and rich culture. As you wander down Eolou (Aeolou) Street, you're enveloped in the essence of the city, where the air is filled with the tantalising aroma of freshly brewed Greek coffee and mouthwatering souvlaki sizzling on open grills. 

Besides an array of cafes, restaurants, and shops selling Greek produce, Bob W Eolou is situated a mere 5-minute walk from the Monastiraki metro station, granting swift access to the rest of the city's wonders. The Ancient Agora of Athens is a short 9-minute stroll from the building, while the majestic Acropolis is 1.3 km away, making this location a perfect starting point for exploring the city's most iconic landmarks.",hello@bobw.co,Bob W Eolou Athens,74,$$,$84 - $124,#107 of 396 hotels in Athens,396.0,4.5,3.860879182815552,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/0f/64/5a/blend-hotel.jpg
