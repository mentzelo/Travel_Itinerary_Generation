Meze is a selection of small dishes, resembling appetizers or tapas. They are served in a random order and are shared by all dining companions. They are not served all together, but each dish arrives at the table as soon as it is prepared. Therefore, there are no starters or main dishes and everyone shares the same small dishes. According to the Mediterranean dining tradition these small dishes are shared between friends and family, while consuming alcoholic drinks, often over the course of an entire evening. The serving of meze is designed to encourage conversation, because people are not so focused upon eating a full course meal set before them. The culture of sharing food brinks people together to communicate and socialize, which makes it a tradition worth exploring...",amalacheinef@gmail.com,Ama Lachei at Nefeli's,https://business.google.com/u/5/menu/l/01445078824295674210,848,$$ - $$$,$14 - $25,"#172 of 3,608 places to eat in Athens",2952.0,4.5,4.365160465240479,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/65/61/83/red-is-the-color.jpg,"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/1a/bd/52/caption.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/02/b7/9b/caption.jpg, https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/02/b7/a5/caption.jpg"

We blend the best of the old with the best of the new. Our décor of dark wood, long bar and warm comfortable environment evoke images of the great old pubs of Ireland whereas our style of operating – our music, food and beverages – connects more so with the contemporary pubs and bars of modern Ireland. Our menu is an introduction to traditional Irish favourites from steak & Guinness pie, sausage & mash to fish & chips, but is also influenced by our Greek & Mediterranean neighbours with dishes such as grilled halloumi & our own version of the famous Greek salad, check out our full menu. Our draught beers are undoubtedly the best in town as our Irish management insures that our products are stored and poured to the highest standard.

Kiki maintained her inventive attitude even in difficult times saying ""all I need is an onion, a bit of bread, and a bottle of wine"". At the Greek Kiki you can try a selection of Greek wines by the glass, both from established and emerging producers and regions. Kiki's list changes often and showcases various Greek wine-making regions every season- including well-known and rare wines from indigenous varieties. You can accompany your wine with dishes prepared with products sourced from all over the country. Highlights include: Greek Trahana-risotto with Kopanisti cheese from the island of Tinos, Santorini fava with capers and smoked Eel from Western Greece, Cheese cake de Grece with Cretan rusks and island cheese - and many more.

We practice whole animal butchery, select rare traditional breeds and also meat from older animals, such as retired dairy cattle. We have an extensive wine list featuring both Greek and global varieties, and desserts such as the ever-popular layered ice-cream cake: 'Ari's Deal Closer'. The special Sunday Roast menu, only available on Sundays, is served in epic family-style portions in the middle of the table for everyone to share and enjoy.

At the corner of Mavromichali and Valtetsiou streets you will find Warehouse, an all-day venue that loves speciality blends, according to us high quality products from all categories. Our coffee is daily roasted at Wisecup Coffee Roasters and comes from speciality, origin and premium coffees from all around the world. You can enjoy your coffee served by our barista or buy your favorite blend to take home. Our wine list includes wines from Greece and the rest of the world by well-known estates, to guest premium wines for private tastings. 200 different wines are served at Warehouse, 70 by the glass and 500 choices for retail in our cellar. Our food menu includes sandwiches, eggs and street food up to dry-aged meat and twisted recipes. Ceviche, carpaccio, orzo pasta with shrimps, beef fillet and daily specials, ask for what suits your taste and we will propose the wine to make it the perfect tasting experience! And if you are passionate about wine and food pairing you can book your own private wine menu. The Warehouse team can create a food menu especially for you as well as the suitable wine pairing. The private wine menu service is available for 4-12 persons. Our bar offers drinks, special distillates, unique premium spirits as well as a full cocktail list with classic and signature recipes that will excite you. Warehouse is a non-smoking wine bar, but if you smoke you can always choose one of the tables at our favorite Valtetsiou sidewalk. We love to change! That is why in April 2017 we opened a second Warehouse in Athens near Syntagma/ Plaka with a focus on sparkling wines. At Warehouse CO2 you can find a great variety of sparkling wines by the glass and by the bottle as well as vintage, awarded and magnum still wines from Greece and abroad. Our menu includes cold dishes, special cheeses, cold cuts and other deli products, which you can also buy for home. Warehouse also serves breakfast to accompany your favorite coffee which is daily roasted at Wisecup Coffee Roasters.",warehouse@warehouse.gr,Warehouse,https://warehouse.gr/en/private-wine-menu/,189,$$ - $$$,$5 - $25,"#375 of 3,608 places to eat in Athens",2952.0,4.5,3.89072847366333,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/ec/68/f5/warehouse-speciality.jpg,"nan, nan, nan"

Warehouse CO2 opened in April 2017 at Syntagma-Plaka to bring the bubbles to our lives and tickle our daily routine! At Warehouse CO2 you can choose from a wide variety of sparkling wines from all around the world by the glass, by the bottle and to take home. Sparkling and semi-sparkling wines from Greece, prosecco, Moscato d'Asti and Franciacorta from Italy, Cava from Spain, champagne from France, but also unexpected origins such as England or Tasmania. Still wines stay in the list at CO2 but come in more special editions. Magnum bottles, vintage and awarded wines stand out in this category. Our food menu includes dishes with unexpected taste combinations as well as deli products, such as cheese and cold cuts, which are served to eat in or buy retail. From bruschettas and gourmet sandwiches to beef carpaccio with black truffle flakes and beetroot with trout eggs, Warehouse's chef Vassilis Geogleris promises once more a unique tasting experience.
